# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results- Key Differences between June and December

- Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively. Given a continental climate, which most in the US are familiar with, this illustrates a marginal difference in average temperature. It seems June and December as just as ideal. 

- Additionally, the maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar. This suggests that most of the year is relatively similar in temperatures given that the times of year with the most contrast still do not offer extreme difference.  

- Still, the greatest variance shown between June and December is in the low temperature in each month: 56 in December and 64 in June. That said, if there is any distinction of when ice cream would be unfavorable in sales, it seems that a December would be the month of potentially weaker profits. The Standard Deviation of December shows that the month's temperatures are little more unpredicatable when compared to June. 

## Summary
At the moment at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees are eligible for retirement and/or being redirected to mentorship initiatives. This implies that Pewlett Hackard are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years, since more than 50% are eligible losses. The good news, however, is that there is an ample pool of qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next genermation. Further querying that isolates specific departments could provide better insight into the areas of the company that stand to be most effected.  Additional queries into manager to employee ratio could aid as well.
